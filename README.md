# RimTraits - Medieval Talents

Adds 35 traits defining a pawn's talent, they are mutually exclusive to each other with increasing rarity for the higher tier traits.

This mod operates on the premise that passion doesn’t equal to talent, and talent doesn’t necessarily translate to passion.

You could really love doing something but you could still suck at it. And likewise, you can have talent with something but you’re not necessarily passionate about them. These traits also give additional Temperature, Mood, Mental Break and Pain Tolerance buff to compensate for the lack of technology during medieval times, and to represent people's ability to face hardships during less civilized ages.

### Features
